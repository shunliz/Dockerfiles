mesosphere-docker-base
=================
This is from the base project:

     https://github.com/sekka1/mesosphere-docker

This is the base Docker image build that all other containers in this project will start from.

This container is not meant to be ran without other stuff installed on it.

This is mainly following instructions from this learn page

     http://mesosphere.io/learn/run-docker-on-mesosphere/
